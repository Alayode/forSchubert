        // 8. Why do we say JavaScript is a dynamic language?

        /*
        *
        * The difference between the term Dynamic and static means that one is changing and one does not respectively.
        * When we talk about dynamic languages this means that when you declare a variable it is bound to a object not the type.
        * So when you speak about statically typed language every variable name is bound to both.
        *

        //In JavaScript -weakly typed.

        x = 10;
        y = "10";
        z = concatenate(a,b); //produces "99"

        v = add(a,b); //produces 18



        //Java- Statically-Type Strong
        x = 10;
        y = "10";

        // would throw an error in Java
        z = concatenate(a,b); //produces "99"
        v = add(a,b); //produces 18
