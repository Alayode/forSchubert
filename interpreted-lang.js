* 7. is JavaScript a Compiled Language?
*
*
* JavaScript was designed to been executed only in the browser when a user opens a page.
* Compiled languages that such as Java does not run in the browser and you would use only javascript
*
*
* JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. A program such as C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run.
* The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that
* the machine understands and can execute. In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step.
* Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.
* More modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation,
* which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
